# Graphic Elements checkout
Graphic Elements Checkout is a Woocommerce plugin designed for a custom t-shirt printing company in the winter of 2018. This plugin contains a custom form to collect t-shirt specific data from customers, jQuery code to make the form interactive, and PHP code to compute the price based on form data and bill the user accordingly. This site is no longer active, but this plugin was used by real customers. This was my first experience writing code for an application where errors were not an option, and it improved my coding ability greatly. This project was written using HTML, CSS, jQuery, and PHP.
